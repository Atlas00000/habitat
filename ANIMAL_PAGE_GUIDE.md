## 🚀 **How to Create New Animal Pages**

### **Step 1: Create Animal Data**

Create a new file in `src/data/` (e.g., `polar-bear-data.ts`):

```typescript
import { Animal } from './deer-data'

export const polarBearData: Animal = {
  name: "Polar Bear",
  scientificName: "Ursus maritimus",
  habitat: "Arctic regions including sea ice, coastal areas, and tundra across the Arctic Circle",
  diet: [
    "Seals (primary prey)",
    "Walrus", 
    "Beluga whales",
    "Fish",
    "Bird eggs",
    "Berries (when available)",
    "Carrion"
  ],
  conservationStatus: "Vulnerable",
  funFacts: [
    "Polar bears are excellent swimmers and can swim for days at a time",
    "They have black skin under their white fur to absorb heat from the sun",
    "Polar bears can smell seals from up to 20 miles away",
    "They are the largest land carnivores on Earth",
    "Polar bears can run up to 25 mph on land",
    "They have special adaptations to survive in temperatures as low as -50°F",
    "Polar bears are actually marine mammals, spending most of their time on sea ice",
    "They can go months without eating during the summer when sea ice melts"
  ],
  stats: {
    weight: "800-1,600 lbs (males), 330-650 lbs (females)",
    height: "6-9 feet when standing on hind legs",
    lifespan: "20-25 years in the wild",
    speed: "25 mph (40 km/h) on land, 6 mph (10 km/h) swimming"
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Create Animal Page**

Create a new page in `app/arctic/polar-bear/page.tsx`:

```typescript
"use client"

import React from 'react'
import { AnimalPage } from '../../../src/components/AnimalPage'
import { polarBearData } from '../../../src/data/polar-bear-data'

export default function PolarBearPage() {
  return (
    <AnimalPage
      animal={polarBearData}
      category="arctic"
      environmentDescription="Explore the harsh Arctic environment with our magnificent polar bear. This apex predator is perfectly adapted to survive in one of the most extreme environments on Earth, with thick fur, black skin for heat absorption, and incredible swimming abilities."
      features={[
        "Arctic ice environment with snow and glaciers",
        "Enhanced polar landscape with realistic lighting",
        "Realistic polar bear with detailed fur and proportions",
        "Scientific name: Ursus maritimus"
      ]}
      backUrl="/arctic"
      backLabel="Back to Arctic"
    />
  )
}
```

### **Step 3: Add to Navigation**

Update the main forest page to include links to animal pages:

```typescript
// In app/forest/page.tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  <Link href="/forest/deer" className="...">
    <div className="...">
      <h3>White-tailed Deer</h3>
      <p>Explore the forest with our majestic deer</p>
    </div>
  </Link>
  {/* Add more animal cards */}
</div>
```

## 📊 **Data Quality Guidelines**

### **✅ Required Information**
1. **Name**: Use specific common name (e.g., "White-tailed Deer" not "Deer")
2. **Scientific Name**: Proper binomial nomenclature (Genus species)
3. **Habitat**: Include geographic range and specific habitat types
4. **Diet**: List from most important to least important food sources
5. **Conservation Status**: Use IUCN Red List categories
6. **Fun Facts**: Include 6-8 interesting, educational facts
7. **Stats**: Be specific with measurements and include context

### **✅ Content Standards**
- **Accuracy**: Verify all information with reliable sources
- **Completeness**: Include all required fields
- **Consistency**: Use metric and imperial units where appropriate
- **Educational Value**: Facts should be interesting and informative
