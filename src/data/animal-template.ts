// Guidelines for creating optimized animal pages:
/*
1. DATA QUALITY:
   - Use accurate scientific names and conservation status
   - Include comprehensive habitat and diet information
   - Provide engaging, educational fun facts
   - Use specific measurements with context

2. CAMERA OPTIMIZATION:
   - Set appropriate initial camera position for best view
   - Configure distance limits based on model size
   - Adjust Y-axis bounds to prevent floor penetration
   - Test camera controls for smooth navigation
   - Use CameraBounds component for automatic boundary enforcement

3. ANIMATION OPTIMIZATION:
   - Enable autoPlay for immediate engagement
   - Set appropriate animation speed (0.5-1.5 range)
   - Configure loop behavior based on animation type
   - Specify preferred animations for better performance
   - Use AnimationControls component for user interaction

4. MODEL OPTIMIZATION:
   - Position models at appropriate height and scale
   - Enable shadows for realistic lighting
   - Set rotation for optimal viewing angle
   - Consider model complexity and performance impact
   - Enable model preloading for faster subsequent loads
   - Set appropriate cache priority (high/medium/low)

5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Enable shadows only when necessary
   - Use fog sparingly for atmospheric effects
   - Limit particle effects for mobile performance
   - Set appropriate draw distances
   - Enable model caching for improved load times
   - Use loading spinners for better UX
   - Implement error retry mechanisms
   - Add progress tracking for long loads

6. USER EXPERIENCE:
   - Provide clear navigation with back buttons
   - Include descriptive environment text
   - List key features for user awareness
   - Ensure responsive design for all devices
   - Add camera position indicators for debugging
   - Include camera help overlay for new users

7. LOADING & CACHING:
   - Enable model preloading for critical assets
   - Use cache status indicators in development
   - Implement progressive loading for large models
   - Add retry logic for failed asset loads
   - Show loading progress for better user feedback

8. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing assets
   - Retry mechanisms for network failures
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Performance monitoring and logging
