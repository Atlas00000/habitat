// Guidelines for creating animal data:
/*
1. NAME: Use common name (e.g., "White-tailed Deer" not just "Deer")
2. SCIENTIFIC NAME: Use proper binomial nomenclature (Genus species)
3. HABITAT: Include geographic range and specific habitat types
4. DIET: List from most important to least important food sources
5. CONSERVATION STATUS: Use IUCN Red List categories
6. FUN FACTS: Include 6-8 interesting, educational facts
7. STATS: Be specific with measurements and include context
8. CONSISTENCY: Use metric and imperial units where appropriate
